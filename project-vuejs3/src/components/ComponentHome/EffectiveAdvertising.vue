          The first thing we see when buying a car is that traveling becomes
          easier. Wherever you want to go, it's more convenient, no need to
          waste time calling a taxi. Not only that, we can also be more
          proactive in terms of time than renting a car. Go when you want to go,
          come back when you want. Not only that, when there is an emergency,
          you can also quickly move to the needed place.

            >Air pollution is becoming more and more serious. Dust, sunlight and
            rain will directly affect our health as well as our family's. Dust
            can cause cancer and respiratory diseases. Young children have weak
            immune systems and inhaling a lot of dust can affect their
            respiratory system. Buying a car to go to work, pick up
            grandparents, parents, and children is also a way to ensure health
            for the whole family.</code

          Today's society often values appearance. So if we own a car, it will
          definitely be more luxurious and classy than a motorbike. Not only
          that, when we travel by car, we will be more appreciated. Our image
          will be more beautiful in everyone's eyes. If we are economically
          prosperous and want to improve our class, buying a car is a great
          choice. In addition to transporting people, cars can also help us
          transport objects. For objects that are not too large but in large
          quantities, using a car is a perfect choice. If we go to the
          supermarket and buy too many things, we can just put the things in the
          trunk or back seat. If we ride a motorbike, we cannot carry things
          comfortably. Cars are very convenient when going on long trips. We can
          plan to go out to places away from home with the whole family on the
          weekend. This will help bond emotions in the family, helping parents,
          children, and siblings closer to each other. If we have a paternal or
          maternal hometown far away, buying a car is even more convenient for
          us to return home to visit relatives.

          Using motorbikes too much makes the environment increasingly polluted.
          So instead of each person using a motorbike, our whole family can go
          out on the same car. This not only reduces emissions significantly.
          Currently, there are cars that use clean materials and use solar
          energy. If we choose a car, especially one that uses clean materials,
          it means we are protecting the environment.
